Robert Kelly - The World's greatest:


I am a mountain,
I am a tall tree, oh
I am a swift wind
Sweeping the country
I am a river,
Down in the valley, oh
I am a vision
And I can see clearly
If anybody asks you who I am, just stand up tall, look 'em in the face and say
I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey I made it, hmm
I'm the worlds greatest
I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it, hmm
I'm the worlds greatest
I am a giant
I am an Eagle oh
I am a lion
Down in the jungle
I am a marching band
I am the people oh
I am a helping hand
I am a hero
If anybody asks you who I am, just stand up tall look 'em in the face and say
I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey I made it, hmm
I'm the worlds greatest
I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it, hmm
I'm the worlds greatest
In the ring of life,
I'll reign in love (I will reign)
And the world will notice a king (oh, yeah)
When all is darkness,
I'll shine a light (shine a light)
And the mirrors of success reflect in me (Me)
I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey I made it
I'm the worlds greatest
I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the worlds greatest
I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey I made it
I'm the worlds greatest
I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the worlds greatest
I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey I made it
I'm the worlds greatest
I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the worlds greatest
Can you feel it?
(Can you feel it?)He's the greatest
(He's the greatest)Can you feel it?
(Can you feel it?)I saw the light
(He's the greatest)At the end of the tunnel
(Can you feel it?)Believe in a pot of gold
(He's the greatest)At the end of a rainbow
